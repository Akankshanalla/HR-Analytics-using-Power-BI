### Project Title:
HR Analytics Dashboard Using Power BI
________________________________________
About the Project:
This HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into employee attrition patterns within an organization. By leveraging Power BI for data visualization, it enables HR managers and decision-makers to analyse key factors influencing employee turnover, including demographic trends, job satisfaction, and business travel patterns. The dashboard uses an HR dataset containing attributes such as employee demographics, job roles, marital status, years of service, and education levels.
The primary goal is to offer actionable insights to optimize workforce management and reduce attrition.
